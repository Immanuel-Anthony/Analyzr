Connected the analysis part with the analysis part



#To Be done - As of 29/01/2025

We need to add a LOG OUT button on the top right of the page.

When you click on download button, it downloads the latest docx, even if it is not the same as the repo which is being analyzed.
-Make it so that it only downloads a document once and then when you analyze another repo, it will download the repo you analyzed just now

Need to make the loading screen appear again : When you analyze something and then analyze something else, it does not show you the loading bar
-Im assuming because the variable in the app2.py file (analysis_status = {} I guess) is making it so that it wont show up

Change the landing page so that it shows either login to github or just enter a url. Rn it shows you logged in and also shows url
-Does not show url part when you are not logged in.

UI PART :
I think we can make the repo list page better looking
I think we can add more stuff to the download and analysis page
